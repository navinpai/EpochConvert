# EpochConvert

### What?

A chrome addon to convert Epoch time to Human readable format

### But Why?

Well, a couple of people at work were working with epoch timestamps and were using EpochConverter as an always open tab to convert timestamps.

The tab switch they kept doing was super irritating, so coded this up over 15 minutes to get rid of that.

Saves a few seconds every time, which might be minutes over a week, which might be hours over the years! :)

Of course, there's many other extensions that do the same thing, but this does JUST that. No other bloat. WYSIWYG.
